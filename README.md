# Hi, I’m Mark 👋

I’m building a **Computer Science learning portfolio** that translates coursework into **real-world engineering skills**.  
My goal: learn the fundamentals deeply, document them clearly, and show measurable progress over time.

## What I’m learning (and why it matters)

I’m focusing on the skills that show up everywhere in production software:

- **Problem solving & algorithms** → turning requirements into step-by-step logic
- **Control flow** (conditionals, loops) → decision-making and automation
- **Functions & decomposition** → building maintainable, testable logic
- **Data structures** (arrays → linked lists) → performance, memory, tradeoffs
- **Object-oriented design** (classes, encapsulation) → clean boundaries & change-friendly code
- **I/O and files** → working with real inputs, outputs, and persistence

## How this portfolio is organized

This isn’t a “dump of school files.” It’s a **concept-first system**:

- **Topics are documented as concepts** (what it is, how it works, common mistakes, real-world use)
- **Reflections track growth** (what I struggled with, what fixed it, what I’d do differently now)
- **Real-world mapping connects theory to practice** (where this concept shows up in software teams)
- **Outcomes show performance trends** (grades/breakdowns + what they taught me)

---

## Integrity & what I publish (important)

I do **not** publish graded assignment solutions or anything that would violate course policies on unauthorized assistance or sharing.  
Instead, I publish:

- Concept explanations in my own words  
- Original diagrams / notes / summaries  
- Pseudocode or small illustrative examples (not copied submissions)  
- Reflections on what I learned and how I improved  

This keeps the portfolio useful **and** academically honest. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Current focus

Right now I’m working on:
- Strengthening fundamentals (clear logic, clean decomposition)
- Improving speed and accuracy on problems under time constraints
- Building a stronger mental model for memory + data structures
- Writing clearer documentation (so future-me can learn faster)

---

## A quick note on how I work

- I prefer **clarity over cleverness**
- I write things down until the concept is explainable in plain language
- I treat mistakes as data and adjust my process
