# Hi, I’m Mark 👋

I’ve been a **self-taught programmer for 10+ years**, and I’m now pursuing a **Computer Science degree** to strengthen and formalize the foundation behind what I’ve built in practice.

This portfolio documents that journey — translating coursework into real-world engineering skills, with measurable growth and structured reflection.

## Why I’m Doing This

After a decade of practical programming experience, I realized:

- I could build things.
- I could debug and ship.
- But I wanted deeper theoretical clarity.
- I wanted stronger algorithmic thinking.
- I wanted formal data structure understanding.
- I wanted to remove blind spots in fundamentals.

This degree is not a reset — it’s an upgrade.

## What I’m strengthening

I’m focusing intentionally on:

- **Problem solving & algorithm design**
- **Control flow mastery**
- **Function decomposition & abstraction**
- **Data structures** (arrays → linked lists → tradeoffs)
- **Object-oriented design & encapsulation**
- **Memory models & references**
- **File I/O & structured input/output**

Each concept is documented in my repos with:
- Plain-language explanations
- Mental models
- Common mistakes
- Real-world mapping
- Personal reflection

## How this portfolio is organized

This is not a dump of assignments.

It is a structured learning system:

- Concepts are documented independently of homework.
- Growth is tracked through reflection.
- Real-world applications are mapped explicitly.
- Academic performance trends are recorded transparently.

The goal is clarity, not clutter.

---

## Integrity & Academic Standards

I do **not** publish graded assignment solutions or any material that would violate course policies on unauthorized assistance or sharing.

Instead, I publish:
- Original explanations
- My own diagrams and summaries
- Pseudocode or fresh examples
- Learning reflections and process adjustments

This keeps the portfolio valuable and academically honest. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Current Focus

- Deepening data structure intuition
- Improving algorithm speed under test constraints
- Writing clearer technical explanations
- Tightening abstraction boundaries in OOP design

---

## How I Think

- Clarity over cleverness.
- Fundamentals over shortcuts.
- Systems thinking over isolated fixes.
- Reflection over repetition.

If you're also formalizing self-taught experience through structured CS learning, I’d be glad to connect.
