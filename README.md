# Mark Campbell

Software engineer with 10+ years of self-taught programming experience, currently pursuing a Computer Science degree to formalize and deepen my foundation in algorithms, data structures, and systems thinking.

This profile documents that progression in a structured, concept-first format.

## Professional Context

For over a decade, I’ve built software through practical experience.  
Pursuing a CS degree allows me to:

- Strengthen algorithmic rigor
- Improve data structure fluency
- Formalize abstraction and object-oriented design
- Develop deeper understanding of memory and performance tradeoffs
- Remove theoretical blind spots

This is an intentional refinement of an existing skill set — not an introduction to programming.

---

## Areas of Focus

- Algorithmic problem solving  
- Control flow and structured logic  
- Functional decomposition  
- Object-oriented design and encapsulation  
- Memory references and dynamic structures  
- Searching and sorting strategies  
- File I/O and structured data handling  

Each topic repository includes:
- Concept explanations in plain language  
- Tradeoff analysis  
- Real-world applicability  
- Reflection on learning adjustments  
- Performance trends across assessments  

---

## Documentation Philosophy

This portfolio is concept-driven rather than assignment-driven.

I do not publish graded solutions or course materials that would violate academic integrity policies.

Instead, I publish:
- Original concept summaries
- Independent examples
- Design notes
- Process refinements
- Performance analysis

The goal is to demonstrate understanding, not replicate coursework.

## Current Development Priorities

- Improving time efficiency under constrained testing environments  
- Strengthening data structure intuition beyond implementation mechanics  
- Writing clearer technical explanations  
- Designing cleaner abstraction boundaries
